# Connecting to AWS

## Introduction

The following instructions are for attendees for whom an AWS F1 instance has been set by Xilinx, and have been provided with log-in details. If you are not intended to use F1 instance provided by Xilinx, go back to the [Setup Vitis](setup_vitis.md) page and follow one of the other options to work through these labs.

This lab will guide you through the steps involved in connecting to a Xilinx provided AWS EC2 F1 instance, and starting and stopping the instance.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Connect to an AWS EC2 F1 instance using the provided credentials
- Start an instance
- Start a RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) session
- Close the RDP session
- Stop the instance

## Steps
Each registered participant to Xilinx workshop/webinar has been allocated a pre-configured EC2 F1 instance and should have received an email with the following details:  

- Account ID,
- IAM username,
- Link to access a pre-configured EC2 F1 instance

### Login into the AWS and starting an F1 instance

1. Follow the link provided by your instructor, or go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) to open a login page. Use `xilinx-aws-f1-developer-labs` in *Account ID or alias*. If you had used the link then you should see a login page similar to shown here:

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-1.png)

2. Use the log in details provided to you

3. In the top right corner, using the drop-down button, select a region with F1 instances, such as **N. Virginia (US East)** or the region indicated by your instructor

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-3.png)

  If you select the wrong region you may not see your instance or you won't see the necessary source and solution files

4. Click on the **EC2** link on the dashboard or if not visible, then click on the _Services_ drop-down button and then click on **EC2**

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-4-1.png)
  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-4-2.png)

5. Click on the **Instances** link on the left panel

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-5.png)

  You may see several instances

6. Enter your username in the filter field just below the **Launch Instance** button and hit enter

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-6.png)

7. Making sure that your instance is selected, click on the **Actions > Instance State > Start**

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-7.png)

8. Wait for about 30 seconds and then click on the refresh button(![alt tag](./images/Fig-refresh.png)) to see the updated status to *running*

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-8.png)

9. Make a note of the Public DNS and IPv4 Public IP which will be used by PuTTy and Remote Desktop (RDP)

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-9.png)

  **At this point you have three options to connect to AWS instance: RDP or NICE DCV for desktop like interface, and PuTTY for command line interface**

  **The instance provided to you has already been setup for RDP**

### Connect using RDP

**You can communicate with the instance using command line through PuTTY or Git Bash, and using GUI through remote desktop (RDP) connection.**

1. Start a remote desktop session

1. Enter the *IPv4* address

1. Click on the **Show Options**

  ![](./images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-10.png)

4. Select the **Display** tab and select *True Color (24 bit)* and click **Connect**

  ![](./images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-11.png)

5. A certificate warning will be displayed. Click **Yes** to open the RDP session

6. Enter **centos** as the username and enter the provided password and click **OK**

  ![](./images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-12.png)

  **Continue to [Lab setup](#lab-setup)**

### Connecting to AWS instance using NICE DCV

NICE DCV as recommended by Amazon will be used to remote desktop to the instance.

* Download and install the appropriate NICE DCV client if necessary from here: https://download.nice-dcv.com

The NICE DCV session has already been started on the instance provided. See the Appendix for details on how to setup a session.

#### Start NICE DCV

* Open the NICE DCV application, enter the *IPv4 Public IP* from the Amazon console and click **Open**

  ![](./images/nice_dcv.png)

* When prompted, enter the username and password provided by your instructor to connect to the instance.

  ![](./images/nice_dcv_desktop.png)

  **Continue to [Lab setup](#lab-setup)**

## Lab setup

1. Exectue the following to clone the *aws-fpga* repository and setup the Xilinx tools. `aws-fpga` includes the AWS F1 tools, HDK and documentation:

  ```sh
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga
   cd ~/aws-fpga                                         
   source vitis_setup.sh
   source vitis_runtime_setup.sh
  ```

For more details see:

https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/blob/master/Vitis/README.md

---------------------------------------

Proceed to the first lab [Introduction to Vitis](GUI_Flow_lab.md).

---------------------------------------

## Appendix

### Set up the NICE DCV session

1. Open PuTTY, enter the IPv4 Public IP address from the Amazon console, and click open

  ![](./images/putty_ip4.png)

  This should open a terminal to the AWS instance.

1. In the terminal, enter the following command to start the DCV server:

  ```sh
  dcv create-session --type virtual --user centos centos
  ```

  ![](./images/putty_dcv.png)

1. Stop the firewall

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl disable firewalld
  sudo systemctl stop firewalld
  ```

### Interacting with the Instance using Putty

1. Start **PuTTY** or your preferred SSH client

1. Enter *centos@<public\_dns\_entry>* in the **Host Name** field and **22** in the *Port* field  
  Make sure that SSH is selected as the Connection type

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-15.png)

1. Expand **SSH** under the *Connection* in the left panel and click **Auth**

1. Click on the **Browseâ€¦** button, browse to where the private key has been stored  
  If you don&#39;t have the private key file (as in workshop) you can skip this step

1. Click **Open**

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-16.png)

1. Click **Yes**.
  The PuTTY window will open. It will ask for the password (in case of the workshop). Enter the provided password

  ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-17.png)

1. Set a password for the RDP connection with the following command

  ```sh
  sudo passwd <your choice of password>
  ```

  You will use the same password in the RDP connection.

1. Enter **exit** to close the session
